# Issue #80: Replace print() with structured logging

## Description

The FileHasher class uses print() for error reporting in library code, which doesn't integrate with application logging systems.

## Current Problem

- No Log Levels: Can't distinguish debug/info/warning/error
- No Control: Host application can't filter or redirect output
- Testing Issues: Hard to capture and verify in tests
- Production Unfriendly: Output goes to stdout, not log aggregators

## Proposed Solution

Replace print() with proper logging:
- Import logging module
- Create module-level logger
- Replace print() with logger.warning()
- Use proper string formatting (%s not f-strings)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Import logging module at top of file
- [ ] Create module-level logger
- [ ] Replace print() with logger.warning()
- [ ] Use proper string formatting
- [ ] Remove comment about "production system"
- [ ] Add test verifying log output
- [ ] Verify no other print() statements

## Technical Details

**File**: `src/file_organizer/services/deduplication/hasher.py` (line 116)
**Priority**: Low (code quality)
**Fix Complexity**: Trivial (3-5 lines)
