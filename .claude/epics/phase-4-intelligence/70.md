# Issue #70: Consolidate duplicate ImageMetadata class

## Description

The ImageMetadata class is duplicated between `image_utils.py` and `viewer.py`, violating DRY principle and creating maintenance burden.

## Current Problem

- Code duplication increases maintenance burden
- Changes must be synchronized across files
- Risk of divergent implementations
- Violates single responsibility principle

## Proposed Solution

1. Create shared model module: `src/file_organizer/models/image.py`
2. Define canonical `ImageMetadata` class
3. Update both files to import from shared module
4. Ensure all fields and methods are consolidated

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Single `ImageMetadata` definition in `models/image.py`
- [ ] Both files import from models
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] No duplicate code remains
- [ ] Tests pass for both modules
- [ ] Type hints maintained

## Technical Details

**Files**: `image_utils.py` and `viewer.py`
**Priority**: Medium
**Impact**: Reduces technical debt
