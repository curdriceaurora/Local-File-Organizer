# Issue #73: Eliminate duplicate I/O in quality assessment

## Description

Quality assessment performs duplicate file I/O operations, reading the same files multiple times for different quality checks.

## Current Problem

- Multiple I/O operations for the same file
- Performance penalty especially on slow storage
- Redundant disk seeks and reads
- Scales poorly with large file sets

## Proposed Solution

1. Read file once and extract all needed information
2. Cache file metadata during quality assessment
3. Pass metadata between assessment methods
4. Use PIL.Image.open() once and extract all properties

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] File read once per quality assessment
- [ ] All quality checks use cached metadata
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show improvement
- [ ] Quality assessment results unchanged
- [ ] Tests pass for all image formats

## Technical Details

**File**: `src/file_organizer/services/deduplication/quality.py` (lines 388-408)
**Priority**: Medium
**Expected Impact**: 2-3x speedup for quality assessment
