# Task 010: Add auto-tagging suggestion system

## Objective
Develop an intelligent auto-tagging system that analyzes file content and user behavior to suggest relevant tags automatically, learning from user-applied tags to improve recommendations over time.

## Description
This task builds on the smart suggestions infrastructure (Task 009) to provide automatic tag recommendations. The system will analyze file content, learn from user tagging patterns, and integrate with the preference learning system (Task 004) to provide personalized tag suggestions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Analyze file content for automatic tag suggestions
- Learn from user-applied tags to improve recommendations
- Tag recommendation engine with confidence scores
- Integration with preference learning system
- Support for custom tag taxonomies
- Batch tagging suggestions for multiple files
- Tag hierarchy and relationship management

### Technical Requirements
- Content analysis using AI models
- Machine learning for tag pattern recognition
- Integration with Task 009 (smart suggestions)
- Integration with Task 004 (user preferences)
- Integration with Task 005 (duplicate detection patterns)
- Tag suggestion ranking algorithm
- Performance optimization for real-time suggestions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Content analysis generates relevant tag suggestions
- [ ] System learns from user tagging behavior
- [ ] Tag recommendations improve over time (measurable)
- [ ] Confidence scores for all tag suggestions
- [ ] Integration with preference learning system
- [ ] Support for batch tagging operations
- [ ] Tag suggestion accuracy >75%
- [ ] Response time <500ms for single file
- [ ] Batch processing: 100 files in <10 seconds
- [ ] Unit tests with >85% coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for all workflows
- [ ] User documentation for auto-tagging

## Implementation Details

### Components to Develop
1. **Content Tag Analyzer**
   - File content extraction
   - Keyword extraction
   - Topic modeling
   - Entity recognition
   - Contextual analysis

2. **Tag Learning Engine**
   - User tagging pattern analysis
   - Tag co-occurrence tracking
   - Tag usage frequency analysis
   - Personalized tag models
   - Tag relationship mapping

3. **Tag Recommendation Engine**
   - Suggestion generation
   - Confidence scoring
   - Ranking algorithm
   - Deduplication
   - Explanation generation

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Smart suggestions integration (Task 009)
   - Preference learning integration (Task 004)
   - Duplicate detection integration (Task 005)
   - User feedback loop

### Files to Create/Modify
- `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/services/auto_tagging.py`
- `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/services/tag_learning.py`
- `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/services/tag_recommender.py`
- `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/models/tag_types.py`
- `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/core/tag_analyzer.py`
- `file_organizer_v2/tests/test_auto_tagging.py`
- `file_organizer_v2/tests/test_tag_learning.py`

### Algorithm Approach
1. **Content Analysis**
   - Extract text content from files
   - Generate keywords using TF-IDF
   - Apply topic modeling (LDA)
   - Use AI models for semantic understanding
   - Combine multiple signals

2. **Learning Model**
   - Track user tag applications
   - Build user-specific tag profiles
   - Identify tag patterns
   - Update model with feedback
   - Periodic model retraining

3. **Recommendation Generation**
   - Combine content-based and behavior-based signals
   - Calculate confidence scores
   - Rank by relevance and confidence
   - Filter low-confidence suggestions
   - Provide explanations

## Dependencies
- **Task 009**: Smart suggestions infrastructure (required)
- **Task 004**: User preference learning (required for personalization)
- **Task 005**: Duplicate detection (required for pattern insights)

## Estimated Effort
- **Size**: M
- **Hours**: 16
- **Parallel**: Cannot run in parallel (depends on tasks 009, 50, 005)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for tag analysis components
- Integration tests with dependency tasks
- Accuracy testing with labeled datasets
- Performance benchmarks
- A/B testing for recommendation quality
- User acceptance testing

## Notes
- Start after Task 009 is complete
- Requires Task 004 and 005 for full functionality
- Consider privacy implications of learning user behavior
- Plan for tag taxonomy management
- Support for multi-language tags (future)
- Consider tag synonym handling
