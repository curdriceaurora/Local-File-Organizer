# Task 005: Implement pattern learning from user feedback

## Description
Implement intelligent pattern learning that adapts to user feedback. The system learns naming patterns from corrections, remembers folder preferences, integrates a feedback loop, and maintains confidence scores for learned patterns.

## Objectives
- Learn naming patterns from user corrections
- Remember and apply folder preferences
- Implement continuous feedback loop integration
- Develop confidence scoring system for learned patterns

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Naming Pattern Learning**
   - Extract patterns from user file renaming
   - Identify common naming conventions
   - Learn prefix/suffix preferences
   - Detect date format preferences
   - Understand delimiter conventions (underscore, hyphen, camelCase)

2. **Folder Preference Memory**
   - Track which folders users choose for specific file types
   - Learn document categorization preferences
   - Remember project-specific folder structures
   - Adapt to workflow-based organization

3. **Feedback Loop Integration**
   - Continuous learning from user actions
   - Real-time preference updates
   - Batch learning from correction history
   - Adaptive confidence adjustment

4. **Confidence Scoring**
   - Calculate confidence for each learned pattern
   - Weight by recency and frequency
   - Decay old patterns over time
   - Threshold-based pattern application

### Technical Requirements
- Pattern extraction algorithms
- Statistical learning for preference identification
- Confidence calculation engine
- Integration with PreferenceTracker from Task 004
- Incremental learning capabilities

## Implementation Details

### Pattern Learning Engine
```python
class PatternLearner:
    def learn_from_correction(self, original, corrected, context)
    def extract_naming_pattern(self, filename_list)
    def identify_folder_preference(self, file_type, chosen_folder)
    def update_confidence(self, pattern_id, success)
    def get_pattern_suggestion(self, file_info, min_confidence)
```

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm
```
confidence = (frequency * 0.4) + (recency * 0.3) + (consistency * 0.3)

where:
- frequency: normalized count of pattern usage
- recency: time-decay weighted recent usage
- consistency: variance in pattern application
```

### Key Components
1. **NamingPatternExtractor**
   - analyze_filename(filename)
   - extract_common_elements(filename_list)
   - identify_structure_pattern()
   - suggest_naming_convention()

2. **FolderPreferenceLearner**
   - track_folder_choice(file_type, folder)
   - get_preferred_folder(file_type, confidence_threshold)
   - analyze_organization_patterns()
   - suggest_folder_structure()

3. **FeedbackProcessor**
   - process_correction(correction_event)
   - batch_process_history()
   - update_learning_model()
   - trigger_retraining()

4. **ConfidenceEngine**
   - calculate_confidence(pattern, usage_data)
   - decay_old_patterns(time_threshold)
   - boost_recent_patterns()
   - validate_confidence_threshold()

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] System learns naming patterns from 5+ corrections
- [ ] Folder preferences achieved >80% accuracy after 20 corrections
- [ ] Feedback loop processes corrections in real-time
- [ ] Confidence scores accurately reflect pattern reliability
- [ ] Learned patterns improve organization accuracy by 30%
- [ ] Pattern suggestions respect confidence thresholds
- [ ] Old patterns decay appropriately (>90 days)
- [ ] Integration tests with PreferenceTracker pass
- [ ] Performance: pattern learning < 50ms per correction

## Dependencies
- Task 004: Build preference tracking system (required)

## Estimated Effort
- Size: L (Large)
- Hours: 24
- Can be parallelized: No (depends on Task 004)

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for each learning component
2. Integration tests with PreferenceTracker
3. Pattern extraction accuracy tests
4. Confidence scoring validation tests
5. Feedback loop end-to-end tests
6. Performance benchmarks for learning operations
7. User simulation tests with synthetic corrections

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Pattern Extraction (8 hours)
- Implement NamingPatternExtractor
- Add folder preference learning
- Basic pattern identification

### Phase 2: Confidence System (8 hours)
- Build ConfidenceEngine
- Implement scoring algorithms
- Add decay mechanisms

### Phase 3: Feedback Integration (8 hours)
- Implement FeedbackProcessor
- Real-time learning integration
- Batch processing capabilities
- End-to-end testing

## Notes
- Pattern learning should be conservative initially (high confidence thresholds)
- Consider privacy: patterns should not leak sensitive information
- Allow users to view and edit learned patterns
- Provide feedback on learning progress (e.g., "Still learning..." vs "Confident")
- Design for future ML model integration (e.g., neural networks)
- Consider supporting multiple users with separate learning profiles
