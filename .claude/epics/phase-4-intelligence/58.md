### Deduplication Documentation Template
```markdown
# Deduplication System

## Overview
The File Organizer v2.0 includes an advanced deduplication system that identifies and safely removes duplicate files, reclaiming valuable storage space.

## How It Works
### Hash-Based Detection
- Uses SHA-256 for exact duplicate detection
- Fast and reliable for identical files
- Works with any file type

### Content-Based Comparison
- Byte-by-byte comparison for verification
- Handles hash collisions (rare)
- Ensures 100% accuracy

### Perceptual Hashing (Images)
- Detects visually similar images
- Configurable similarity threshold
- Useful for finding near-duplicates

## Usage Examples
### Basic Duplicate Scan
```bash
organize deduplicate /path/to/directory
```

### Safe Mode (Review Before Deletion)
```bash
organize deduplicate /path/to/directory --safe
```

### Custom Similarity Threshold
```bash
organize deduplicate /path/to/directory --threshold 95
```

detector = DuplicateDetector()
duplicates = detector.detect_duplicates(Path("/home/user/documents"))

for cluster in duplicates:
