# Issue #81: Consolidate duplicate SUPPORTED_FORMATS constant

## Description

The SUPPORTED_FORMATS constant is duplicated between image_dedup.py and image_utils.py, creating a maintenance burden and potential for inconsistencies.

## Current Problem

- DRY Violation: Same constant defined twice
- Maintenance Risk: Changes must be synchronized across files
- Potential Divergence: One file might get updated without the other
- Single Source of Truth: Should be defined once and imported

## Proposed Solution

**Option 1**: Import from image_utils.py (Simple - Recommended)
**Option 2**: Move to shared constants module (Better for Scale)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Choose consolidation approach
- [ ] Remove duplicate constant definition
- [ ] Add import statement in dependent file
- [ ] Verify no other duplicates exist
- [ ] Run tests
- [ ] Check for circular import issues

## Technical Details

**File**: `src/file_organizer/services/deduplication/image_dedup.py` (line 23)
**Priority**: Low (code quality)
**Fix Complexity**: Trivial (2-3 lines)
**Related**: Issue #70 (ImageMetadata duplication)
