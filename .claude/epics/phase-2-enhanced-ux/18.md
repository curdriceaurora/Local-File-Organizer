## Description

Set up the complete development environment for Phase 2 Enhanced UX work. This includes installing and verifying all required dependencies (Typer 0.9+, Textual 0.50+, PyYAML 6.0+), configuring the development workspace, and ensuring all tools are properly integrated and functional.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Typer 0.9+ is installed and verified working
- [ ] Textual 0.50+ is installed and verified working
- [ ] PyYAML 6.0+ is installed and verified working
- [ ] All dependencies are documented in pyproject.toml
- [ ] Development workspace is configured correctly
- [ ] Basic smoke tests pass for all dependencies
- [ ] Documentation updated with setup instructions

## Technical Details

### Dependencies to Install
- **Typer 0.9+**: Modern CLI framework with excellent type hints and auto-completion
- **Textual 0.50+**: Terminal UI framework for interactive interfaces
- **PyYAML 6.0+**: YAML parsing and serialization for configuration files

### Installation Steps
1. Update pyproject.toml with new dependencies
2. Install via poetry/pip as appropriate
3. Create simple test scripts to verify each dependency
4. Document any platform-specific requirements

### Verification Tests
- Typer: Create basic CLI command and test execution
- Textual: Create minimal TUI app and verify rendering
- PyYAML: Test loading and saving YAML files

## Dependencies

**Depends on:** None (Foundation task)

**Blocks:**
- Task 002: Configuration system needs these dependencies
- All subsequent Phase 2 tasks

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** XS
- **Estimated Hours:** 4
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Risk Level:** Low

**Breakdown:**
- Dependency installation and verification: 2 hours
- Documentation and testing: 1 hour
- Troubleshooting and configuration: 1 hour

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All three dependencies installed with correct versions
- [ ] pyproject.toml updated with dependency specifications
- [ ] Smoke tests created and passing for each dependency
- [ ] Development environment documented in README or setup guide
- [ ] No conflicts with existing dependencies
- [ ] Successfully run on at least one platform (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- [ ] Changes committed with clear documentation
