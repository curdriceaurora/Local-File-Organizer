# Task: Set up Textual TUI framework and basic structure

## Description
Initialize the Textual framework and create the foundational terminal user interface (TUI) structure. This includes setting up the basic layout, navigation system, and keyboard shortcuts that will serve as the foundation for the interactive file browser and organization interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Textual framework installed and configured
- [ ] Basic TUI application scaffold created
- [ ] Main layout structure with panels/sections defined
- [ ] Navigation system implemented (tab between sections, arrow keys, etc.)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts system configured
- [ ] Basic styling/theme applied
- [ ] TUI can be launched from CLI
- [ ] Graceful exit and error handling

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach:
  - Set up Textual App class as main entry point
  - Create layout with header, main content area, and footer
  - Implement widget containers for future components
  - Define keyboard bindings schema
  - Create basic theme/styling configuration
  - Add help screen for keyboard shortcuts
- Key considerations:
  - Terminal compatibility across different OS
  - Responsive layout for various terminal sizes
  - Accessibility (screen reader friendly where possible)
  - Performance for smooth rendering
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/tui/__init__.py` (new)
  - `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/tui/app.py` (new)
  - `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/tui/layout.py` (new)
  - `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/tui/keybindings.py` (new)
  - `file_organizer_v2/demo.py` (add TUI launch command)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 - Basic project structure should be in place
- [ ] Textual 0.50+ framework
- [ ] Rich library for text formatting

## Effort Estimate
- Size: S
- Hours: 8
- Parallel: true (can run in parallel with Tasks 003, 29, and 005)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented for TUI framework and basic structure
- [ ] Tests written for app initialization and navigation
- [ ] Documentation updated with TUI architecture overview
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] TUI launches successfully and responds to keyboard input
