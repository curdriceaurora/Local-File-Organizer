# Task 012: Set up PyInstaller build pipeline

## Description
Configure PyInstaller for the project to enable building standalone executables for macOS, Windows, and Linux. Create automated build scripts and integrate with CI/CD pipeline.

## Requirements
- Configure PyInstaller with optimal settings for the project
- Create build scripts for automation across platforms
- Set up CI/CD integration for automated builds
- Ensure proper dependency bundling
- Configure code signing preparation

## Success Criteria
- PyInstaller successfully configured and working
- Build scripts created and tested locally
- CI/CD pipeline produces builds automatically
- All dependencies correctly bundled
- Documentation for build process created

## Technical Notes
- Use PyInstaller spec files for configuration
- Consider virtual environment isolation
- Handle AI model files appropriately (exclude or bundle based on size)
- Set up separate build jobs for each platform
- Prepare for code signing requirements

## Dependencies
- Task 001: CLI interface must be complete

## Deliverables
- PyInstaller configuration files (.spec)
- Build automation scripts
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Build process documentation
- Dependency management strategy
