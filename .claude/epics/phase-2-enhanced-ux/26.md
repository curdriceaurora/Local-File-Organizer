# Task: Implement copilot mode - chat interface

## Description
Create an interactive chat interface that allows users to organize files using natural language commands. This includes building a multi-turn conversation system with context management, enabling users to have ongoing dialogues with the AI about their file organization needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Chat interface accepts natural language commands (e.g., "read and rename all PDFs")
- [ ] Multi-turn conversation support maintains context across interactions
- [ ] Context management tracks conversation history and file state
- [ ] Commands are parsed and executed through the file organizer
- [ ] Error handling provides helpful feedback to users
- [ ] Chat history can be saved and resumed

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach:
  - Build conversational interface using LLM model for command interpretation
  - Implement conversation state management to track context
  - Create command parser that translates natural language to file operations
  - Integrate with existing file_organizer services
- Key considerations:
  - Context window management for long conversations
  - Ambiguity resolution when commands are unclear
  - Safe command execution with confirmation prompts
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/services/copilot.py` (new)
  - `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/services/conversation.py` (new)
  - `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/core/orchestrator.py` (modify)
  - `file_organizer_v2/demo.py` (modify for copilot mode)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 - Model abstraction layer must be complete
- [ ] Task 002 - Chat model interface must be available
- [ ] Typer CLI framework installed
- [ ] Textual framework for interactive UI components

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 16
- Parallel: true (can run in parallel with other tasks after dependencies complete)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with copilot service and conversation manager
- [ ] Tests written for command parsing and context management
- [ ] Documentation updated with usage examples
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Integration tests passing with sample conversations
