# Task 014: Create Windows executable with installer

## Description
Build Windows executable and create a professional installer using NSIS or similar tool. Ensure compatibility with Windows 10 and 11, handle dependencies, and implement proper code signing.

## Requirements
- Build Windows .exe with PyInstaller
- Create installer with NSIS, Inno Setup, or WiX
- Implement code signing with certificate
- Handle Windows Defender SmartScreen
- Support both installation modes (user/system)
- Test on Windows 10 and 11
- Handle Visual C++ runtime dependencies

## Success Criteria
- Executable runs without errors on Windows 10/11
- Installer works smoothly with proper UI
- Code signing passes without warnings
- SmartScreen allows installation
- All dependencies bundled or installed
- Uninstaller works correctly
- Application properly registered in system

## Technical Notes
- Use PyInstaller for Windows with proper options
- Bundle or install VC++ redistributables
- Create proper Start Menu shortcuts
- Handle UAC elevation if needed
- Use signtool for code signing
- Test with Windows Defender enabled
- Consider both 32-bit and 64-bit builds

## Dependencies
- Task 012: Build pipeline must be ready
- Tasks 003-011: All UX features must be complete

## Deliverables
- Windows executable (.exe)
- Windows installer (.exe or .msi)
- Code signing scripts
- Testing report for Windows 10/11
- Installation documentation
- Troubleshooting guide
