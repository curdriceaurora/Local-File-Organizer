# Task 015: Create Linux AppImage

## Description
Build a portable Linux AppImage that works across major Linux distributions without installation. Package all dependencies and test on multiple distributions.

## Requirements
- Build AppImage with proper structure
- Bundle all required dependencies
- Create desktop integration files
- Test on major distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Debian)
- Handle different library versions across distros
- Implement proper file permissions handling
- Support both x86_64 architectures

## Success Criteria
- AppImage runs on all tested distributions
- No missing dependency errors
- Desktop integration works (icons, file associations)
- Application has proper permissions
- File operations work across different filesystems
- Performance is acceptable
- AppImage passes AppImageLint checks

## Technical Notes
- Use appimagetool or similar for building
- Include AppRun script for initialization
- Bundle Python runtime and dependencies
- Create .desktop file for integration
- Handle glibc version compatibility
- Test on different desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, XFCE)
- Consider continuous build system compatibility

## Dependencies
- Task 012: Build pipeline must be ready
- Tasks 003-011: All UX features must be complete

## Deliverables
- Linux AppImage (.AppImage)
- Desktop integration files
- Testing report for multiple distributions
- Build and packaging documentation
- User installation guide
- Troubleshooting documentation
