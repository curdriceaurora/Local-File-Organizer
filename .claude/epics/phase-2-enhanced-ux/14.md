# Task 013: Create macOS executables (Intel + Apple Silicon)

## Description
Build universal macOS binaries that work on both Intel and Apple Silicon architectures. Create a professional DMG installer with proper code signing and notarization for distribution.

## Requirements
- Build universal binary (x86_64 + arm64)
- Create DMG installer with branded design
- Implement code signing with Apple Developer certificate
- Complete notarization process for Gatekeeper
- Test on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
- Handle macOS security permissions properly

## Success Criteria
- Universal binary runs on both architectures
- DMG installer works correctly
- Application passes Gatekeeper checks
- No security warnings when launching
- All features work on both architectures
- File access permissions handled correctly

## Technical Notes
- Use lipo to create universal binary or build fat binary directly
- Configure PyInstaller for macOS bundle structure
- Include Info.plist with proper permissions
- Use create-dmg or similar for installer
- Set up notarization with Apple's notary service
- Test on macOS 12+ (Monterey and later)

## Dependencies
- Task 012: Build pipeline must be ready
- Tasks 003-011: All UX features must be complete

## Deliverables
- Universal macOS application bundle (.app)
- DMG installer
- Code signing and notarization scripts
- Testing report for both architectures
- Installation and usage documentation
