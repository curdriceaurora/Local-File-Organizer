# Task 012: Enhance EPUB processing

## Description
Implement advanced EPUB ebook processing capabilities including chapter-based analysis, author and genre detection, series recognition, and enhanced metadata extraction from EPUB files.

## Objectives
- Implement chapter-based analysis for ebooks
- Add author and genre detection
- Implement series recognition and ordering
- Enhance metadata extraction from EPUB files

## Technical Details

### Chapter Analysis
- Parse EPUB structure to identify chapters
- Extract chapter titles and content
- Analyze chapter-level metadata
- Support both EPUB 2 and EPUB 3 formats

### Author & Genre Detection
- Extract author information from EPUB metadata
- Detect genre from metadata and content analysis
- Support multiple authors
- Handle pseudonyms and series authors

### Series Recognition
- Detect book series information
- Identify book order in series
- Extract series metadata (series name, volume number)
- Handle multi-series books

### Metadata Enhancement
- Extract publisher information
- Parse publication date
- Extract ISBN and other identifiers
- Parse language and subject information
- Extract cover image metadata

## Files to Modify
- `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/models/epub_processor.py` (new)
- `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/services/file_processor.py`
- `file_organizer_v2/src/file_organizer/utils/metadata_extractor.py`

## Testing Requirements
- Test with various EPUB formats (EPUB 2, EPUB 3)
- Test with books in series vs standalone
- Test with multiple authors
- Test with different genres
- Test metadata extraction accuracy

## Dependencies
- ebooklib or similar EPUB parsing library
- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- lxml for XML parsing

## Success Criteria
- Successfully parse EPUB structure and chapters
- Accurately detect authors and genres
- Correctly identify series information
- Extract comprehensive metadata from EPUB files
- Handle edge cases (missing metadata, malformed files)

## Notes
- Consider using existing libraries like ebooklib for EPUB parsing
- Ensure compatibility with both EPUB 2 and EPUB 3 standards
- Handle cases where metadata is missing or incomplete
