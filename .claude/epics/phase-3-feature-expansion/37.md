# Task 010: Implement Johnny Decimal numbering system

## Description

Implement the Johnny Decimal numbering system for hierarchical folder organization. This system uses a decimal-based numbering scheme (10-19, 20-29, etc.) to organize files and folders in a structured, scalable way.

## Objectives

- Auto-generate hierarchical decimal numbers (10-19, 20-29, etc.)
- Support user-defined numbering schemes
- Handle number conflicts and resolution
- Provide a flexible API for number generation and management

## Requirements

### Auto-generation
- Implement logic to generate Johnny Decimal numbers based on categories and areas
- Support both automatic and manual number assignment
- Provide smart suggestions for number placement
- Handle category boundaries (10-19, 20-29, 30-39, etc.)

### User-defined Schemes
- Allow users to define custom numbering schemes
- Support configuration file for numbering rules
- Enable per-project numbering preferences
- Validate user-defined schemes for consistency

### Conflict Resolution
- Detect number conflicts when adding new items
- Provide conflict resolution strategies
- Suggest alternative numbers when conflicts occur
- Handle renumbering scenarios gracefully

### Integration Points
- Core file organization engine
- Configuration management system
- User interface for number selection
- Reporting and visualization tools

## Technical Approach

1. **Number Generator Module**
   - Create a `JohnnyDecimalGenerator` class
   - Implement category and ID generation logic
   - Support both sequential and gap-based numbering

2. **Configuration Schema**
   - Define numbering scheme configuration format
   - Support JSON/YAML configuration files
   - Implement validation logic

3. **Conflict Detection**
   - Scan existing folder structure for numbers
   - Build conflict detection algorithm
   - Implement resolution strategies

4. **API Design**
   - `generate_number(category, area)` - Generate new number
   - `validate_number(number)` - Check if number is valid
   - `resolve_conflict(number)` - Handle conflicts
   - `renumber(old_number, new_number)` - Renumber items

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System can generate Johnny Decimal numbers automatically
- [ ] User-defined numbering schemes are supported
- [ ] Number conflicts are detected and resolved
- [ ] API is documented and tested
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for large folder structures
- [ ] Unit tests cover all core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests validate end-to-end workflows

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for number generation logic
- Conflict detection and resolution tests
- Configuration validation tests
- Performance tests with large datasets
- Integration tests with file system operations

## Documentation

- API documentation for developers
- User guide for Johnny Decimal system
- Configuration schema documentation
- Examples and best practices

## Estimated Hours

24 hours

## Size
