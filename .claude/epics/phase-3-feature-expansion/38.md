# Task 007: Design PARA categorization system

## Description

Design a comprehensive PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive) categorization system for intelligent file organization. This includes defining the four core categories, creating a rule engine for automatic categorization, and establishing detection heuristics.

## Objectives

- Define clear boundaries for Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive categories
- Create a flexible rule engine architecture for automatic categorization
- Establish heuristics for category detection based on file metadata and content
- Design category configuration schema for user customization

## Requirements

### PARA Categories Definition

**Projects:**
- Time-bound initiatives with clear completion criteria
- Active work with deadlines
- Examples: client projects, course materials, event planning

**Areas:**
- Ongoing responsibilities without end dates
- Maintenance and continuous improvement
- Examples: health, finance, home, professional development

**Resources:**
- Reference materials and knowledge base
- Topics of ongoing interest
- Examples: articles, tutorials, templates, research

**Archive:**
- Completed or inactive items
- Historical reference
- Examples: completed projects, old documents

### Rule Engine Components

1. **Rule Definition Schema:**
   - Condition types (file type, name pattern, content keywords, metadata)
   - Action types (categorize, suggest, flag for review)
   - Priority and conflict resolution

2. **Detection Heuristics:**
   - File naming patterns (date patterns, project codes, keywords)
   - Content analysis (deadline mentions, task lists, reference markers)
   - Metadata inspection (creation date, modification frequency, tags)
   - Contextual relationships (folder structure, file associations)

3. **Category Confidence Scoring:**
   - Multi-factor scoring algorithm
   - Threshold definitions for auto-categorization vs suggestions
   - Uncertainty handling

## Design Specifications

### Rule Engine Architecture

```
RuleEngine
├── RuleParser (parse user-defined and system rules)
├── ConditionEvaluator (evaluate rule conditions)
├── ActionExecutor (execute categorization actions)
├── ConflictResolver (handle conflicting rules)
└── CategoryScorer (confidence scoring)
```

### Heuristic Categories

**Temporal Heuristics:**
- Files with deadline/due date mentions → Projects
- Files modified frequently (weekly) → Areas
- Files not modified in 6+ months → Archive candidates
- Files with completion markers → Archive

**Content Heuristics:**
- Task lists, action items → Projects
- Checklists, routines → Areas
- How-to guides, tutorials → Resources
- "Final", "completed" in filename → Archive

**Structural Heuristics:**
- Nested folder structures → Projects
- Flat organization with version numbers → Projects
- Reference materials (PDFs, articles) → Resources
- Old versioned files → Archive

### Configuration Schema

```yaml
para_rules:
  projects:
    patterns:
      - "project-*"
      - "*-proposal"
    keywords:
      - "deadline"
      - "milestone"
      - "deliverable"
    auto_categorize: true
    confidence_threshold: 0.75

  areas:
    patterns:
      - "routine-*"
      - "*-checklist"
    keywords:
      - "ongoing"
      - "maintenance"
      - "regular"
    auto_categorize: true
    confidence_threshold: 0.75

  resources:
    patterns:
      - "ref-*"
      - "*-guide"
      - "*-template"
    keywords:
      - "reference"
      - "tutorial"
      - "documentation"
    auto_categorize: true
    confidence_threshold: 0.80

  archive:
    patterns:
      - "*-final"
      - "*-archived"
    age_threshold_days: 180
    inactivity_threshold_days: 90
    auto_categorize: false
    confidence_threshold: 0.90
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PARA categories clearly defined with examples and boundaries
- [ ] Rule engine architecture documented and designed
- [ ] Detection heuristics specified for each category
- [ ] Configuration schema created and validated
- [ ] Confidence scoring algorithm defined
- [ ] Conflict resolution strategy documented
- [ ] User customization approach designed
- [ ] Design reviewed and approved

## Testing Strategy

- Review design with PARA methodology experts
- Validate categorization logic with sample file sets
- Test conflict resolution scenarios
- Verify configuration schema completeness

## Dependencies

None - This is a foundational design task

## Technical Notes

- Consider integration with existing AI models for content analysis
- Plan for multilingual support in keyword detection
- Design for extensibility (custom categories, rules)
- Consider performance implications of rule evaluation

## Resources

- PARA methodology documentation (Tiago Forte)
- Existing file organization systems analysis
- User research on categorization preferences
