# Daily Log: 2026-01-24 (Day 2, Week 1)

## Day 2: Audio Processing & Intelligence Foundation 🎵

**Theme**: Launch audio transcription and preference tracking

**Worktrees**:
- `phase3-audio` (feature/phase3-audio-complete)
- `phase4-intelligence` (feature/phase4-foundation)

---

## Completed Today

### Environment Setup
- [x] Install faster-whisper dependencies (already installed: 1.2.1)
- [x] Verify FFmpeg installation (version 8.0.1 confirmed)
- [x] Check Ollama models loaded (Qwen models ready)
- [x] Verify Python environment (Python 3.12+)

### Documentation
- [x] Add FFmpeg to README.md Prerequisites section
- [x] Update audio support status to "In Progress"
- [x] Update Phase 3 roadmap with faster-whisper reference

### Task #42-A: Audio Transcription Engine (Completed!)
- [x] Create `AudioModel` class in models/audio_model.py
- [x] Integrate faster-whisper with availability check
- [x] Add language detection support (auto-detect + explicit)
- [x] Implement transcription pipeline with VAD filtering
- [x] Implement timestamped transcription method
- [x] Add device detection (CPU, CUDA, auto)
- [x] Add compute type mapping for quantization
- [x] Write test script (test_audio_model.py)
- [x] Successful initialization test on base model

### Issue #50-A: Preference Tracking Core (Completed!)
- [x] Design preference schema (6 tables with proper relationships)
- [x] Create database models (preference_database.py)
- [x] Implement preference CRUD operations (add, get, update, delete)
- [x] Add correction tracking (file moves, renames, category changes)
- [x] Add preference history tracking
- [x] Implement folder mappings, naming patterns, category overrides
- [x] Add statistics and analytics queries
- [x] Write comprehensive unit tests (24 tests, 86% coverage)
- [x] Fixed deprecation warnings (datetime.UTC)

## Notes

**Day 2 Focus Areas**:
1. Audio transcription foundation (faster-whisper integration)
2. Preference tracking database layer
3. Both features should have basic tests by end of day

**Success Criteria**:
- AudioModel class functional
- Preference schema defined and tested
- No blockers for Day 3 continuation

- [ ] Implement audio metadata extraction

**Preference Work**:
- [ ] Build preference API layer
- [ ] Add preference querying methods
