# Task: Test Image Deduplication

## Description
Create comprehensive unit tests for services/deduplication/image_dedup.py covering perceptual hashing and similar image detection.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test ImageDeduplicator initialization
- [ ] Test find_duplicates() with various images
- [ ] Test find_similar() similarity threshold logic
- [ ] Test perceptual hashing accuracy
- [ ] Test rotation/flip detection
- [ ] Test resize tolerance
- [ ] Test performance with large image sets
- [ ] Coverage >85% for image_dedup.py

## Technical Details
**File**: tests/services/deduplication/test_image_dedup.py (422 LOC to test)

Key test areas:
- Perceptual hash algorithms
- Similarity scoring
- Transform detection
- False positive rate

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 complete (test infrastructure)
- [ ] Task 013 complete (core dedup tests)
- [ ] Sample image dataset created

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 12-14
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] tests/services/deduplication/test_image_dedup.py created
- [ ] Image dataset with known duplicates created
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Coverage >85%
