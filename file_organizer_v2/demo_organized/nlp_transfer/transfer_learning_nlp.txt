Transfer Learning in Natural Language Processing

Abstract:
This paper examines the effectiveness of transfer learning techniques in NLP tasks. We demonstrate that pre-trained language models fine-tuned on domain-specific data achieve superior performance compared to models trained from scratch, while requiring significantly less training data and computational resources.

Introduction:
Transfer learning has revolutionized computer vision and is now transforming natural language processing. Pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and T5 have shown remarkable ability to capture linguistic patterns that transfer across tasks.

Methodology:
We conducted experiments using three pre-trained models (BERT-base, RoBERTa-large, and GPT-3) across five NLP tasks:
1. Sentiment analysis
2. Named entity recognition
3. Question answering
4. Text summarization
5. Machine translation

Each model was fine-tuned on task-specific datasets ranging from 1,000 to 100,000 examples. We measured accuracy, F1 score, and BLEU score as appropriate for each task.

Results:
Transfer learning approaches consistently outperformed baseline models:
- Sentiment analysis: 92.3% accuracy (vs. 78.5% baseline)
- NER: F1 score of 89.7 (vs. 72.4 baseline)
- Question answering: 84.2% exact match (vs. 61.3% baseline)
- Summarization: ROUGE-L of 0.412 (vs. 0.287 baseline)
- Translation: BLEU score of 31.5 (vs. 24.1 baseline)

Remarkably, fine-tuning with just 10% of the training data achieved 95% of the performance obtained with the full dataset.

Conclusion:
Transfer learning enables high-quality NLP systems with minimal data and compute requirements. This democratizes access to advanced NLP capabilities for researchers and practitioners with limited resources.
